Skykitteh
=========

Skykitteh will take over the world with cuteness!

What?
-----

Skykitteh is a simple service that allows users to modify the code it runs on.

Why?
----

Why not? It is as much an experiment as it is a silly idea. It also has potential to grow.

Who?
----

Skykitteh is created by the users.

When?
-----

Apparently now.

Where?
------

On the internet. Duh!

How?
----

It all starts with a cat, as many things do. In this case it is netcat, that is used to bootstrap the first version.

    nc -l 8080 > ./skykitteh && chmod +x ./skykitteh && ./skykitteh

This scary piece of code listens to the world and blindly saves and executes the code it is given.

From then on, the sky is the limit!

KTHXBYE!
